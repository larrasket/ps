We have repeatedly reviewed evidence of Kissinger's callousness. Some of
it is as inexplicable as it is shocking. There is a macho swagger in
some of Kissinger's remarks. It could, perhaps, be explained away if he
had never wielded power, like---thus far---the gratuitously offensive
Presidential candidate Donald Trump. And one has an awareness that
Kissinger, the longest-lasting and most iconic pariah figure in modern
American history, is but one of a line of men held in fear and contempt
for the immorality of their services rendered and yet protected by the
political establishment in recognition of those same services. William
Tecumseh Sherman, Curtis LeMay, Robert McNamara, and, more recently,
Donald Rumsfeld all come to mind.
