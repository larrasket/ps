#+TITLE: Introduction to QT5

Qt 5 allows us to easily design our program's user interface through a method most people
are familiar with. Qt not only provides us with a powerful user interface toolkit,
called Qt Designer, which enables us to design our user interface without writing a single
line of code, but it also allows advanced users to customize their user interface components
through a simple scripting language called Qt Style Sheets.
