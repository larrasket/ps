#+TITLE: Middleware in ASP.NET

ASP.NET Core introduced a new concept called Middleware. A middleware is nothing but a
component (class) which is executed on every request in ASP.NET Core application. In the
classic ASP.NET, HttpHandlers and HttpModules were part of request pipeline. Middleware is
similar to HttpHandlers and HttpModules where both needs to be configured and executed in
each request.

Typically, there will be multiple middleware in ASP.NET Core web application. It can be
either framework provided middleware, added via NuGet or your own custom middleware. We can
set the order of middleware execution in the request pipeline. Each middleware adds or
modifies http request and optionally passes control to the next middleware component. The
following figure illustrates the execution of middleware components.
