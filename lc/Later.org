#+title: For Later

I used to map my leetcode solutions here, in the [[file: OLDREADME.org][old README]]. However, it got missy because I
passed many problems and in the end it was deprecated. Recently I've found a nice database
of leetcode's with company wise problems. I decided to solve it (I know I will never finish
it) from the bottom up.
