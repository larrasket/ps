#+title: Leetcode Database Solutions (not database questions)

I used to map my leetcode solutions here, in the [[https://github.com/salehmu/leet/blob/main/ps/OLDREADME.org][old README]]. However, it got missy because I
passed many problems and at the end it was deprecated. Recently I've found a nice database
of leetcode's with company wise problems. I decided to solve it (I know I will never finish
it) from the bottom-up.


Problems that are TBD can be found [[file:Later.org][here]].
