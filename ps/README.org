#+title: OJs Problem Solving Solutions

Naming is a little missy, I've a hard dependency on it in my git system, so it is not going
to change soon. However:

+ ~cc/~ Codechef (purged and deprecated)
+ ~cc/~ Codeforces (purged and deprecated)
+ ~cs/~ Codesignal (inactive)
+ ~he/~ Hackerearth (purged and deprecated)
+ ~lc/~ Leetcode (active)
+ ~nt/~ Lintcode (inactive)
+ ~Map/~, ~qwr~, ~tempModule~, ~...~. Dumps, I don't remember why they are here.
