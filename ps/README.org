#+title: Leetcode Database Solutions (not database questions)

I used to map my leetcode solutions here, in the [[file:OLDREADME.org][old README]]. However, it got missy because I
passed many problems and at the end it was deprecated. Recently I've found a nice database
of leetcode's with company wise problems. I decided to solve it (I know I will never finish
it) from the bottom-up.

* Companies
Symbols:
              + */n/a*: lost information.
              + *Y*: yes, very nice.
              + *-*: not bad.
              + *N*: not nice.
