#+TITLE: Uber Preparation
* Map
Uber is one of the largest unicorn companies in the world. Uber's interview is very
concise and many of their interview questions are straightforward. Your technical on-site
interviews may be done on an actual laptop, or it might be on a whiteboard. You will also
have one non-technical discussion with a hiring manager on aspects such as culture Ô¨Åt
during the interview.
